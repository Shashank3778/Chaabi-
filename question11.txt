f(2):

The function is called with x = 2 and the default list l is used.
It appends 0*0 and 1*1 to the list l.
The contents of l are printed: [0, 1].

Output: [0, 1].


f(3, [3, 2, 1]):

The function is called with x = 3 and the list [3, 2, 1] is provided as an argument.
It appends 0*0, 1*1, and 2*2 to the provided list.
The contents of the list are printed: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4].

Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4].


f(3):

The function is called with x = 3 without providing a new list.
Since the default value for l is a mutable object (an empty list []), it retains its state from the previous calls.
It appends 0*0, 1*1, and 2*2 to the existing list.
The contents of the list are printed: [0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4].
Output: [0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4].
